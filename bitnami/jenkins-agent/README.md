```

You can find all the available configuration options in the [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Jenkins Agent Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jenkins).

```console
docker pull bitnami/jenkins-agent:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/jenkins/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/jenkins-agent:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

When you start the Jenkins Agent image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

* For docker-compose add the variable name and value under the application section in the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/jenkins/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

    ```yaml
    jenkins-agent:
      ...
      environment:
        - JENKINS_URL=http://jenkins:port
      ...
    ```

* For manual execution add a `--env` option with each variable and value:

    ```console
    $ docker run -d --name jenkins-agent \
      --env JENKINS_URL=http://jenkins:port \
      bitnami/jenkins-agent:latest
    ```

Available environment variables:

#### User and Site configuration

* `JENKINS_AGENT_WORKDIR`: The working directory of the remoting instance (stores cache and logs by default). Default: **/bitnami/jenkins/home**
* `JENKINS_URL`: Specify the Jenkins root URLs to connect to.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_TUNNEL`: Connect to the specified host and port, instead of connecting directly to Jenkins. Useful when connection to Jenkins needs to be tunneled.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_PROTOCOLS`: Specify the remoting protocols to attempt when instanceIdentity is provided.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_DIRECT_CONNECTION`: Connect directly to this TCP agent port, skipping the HTTP(S) connection.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_INSTANCE_IDENTITY`: The base64 encoded InstanceIdentity byte array of the Jenkins controller.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_WEB_SOCKET`: Make a WebSocket connection to Jenkins rather than using the TCP port. Default: **false**
* `JENKINS_AGENT_SECRET`: Jenkins Agent name.
* `JENKINS_AGENT_NAME`: Jenkins Agent secret.

##### JAVA configuration

* `JAVA_OPTS`: Customize JVM parameters. No defaults.
* `JAVA_HOME`: Java Home directory. Default: **/opt/bitnami/java**

## Logging

The Bitnami Jenkins Agent Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
docker logs jenkins
```

Or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose logs jenkins
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Maintenance

## Customize this image

For customizations, please note that this image is, by default, a non-root container using the user `jenkins` with `uid=1001`.

### Extend this image

To extend the bitnami original image, you can create your own image using a Dockerfile with the format below:

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/jenkins-agent
## Put your customizations below
...
```
