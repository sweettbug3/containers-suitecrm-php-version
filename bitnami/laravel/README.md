## TL;DR

### Local workspace

```console
mkdir ~/myapp && cd ~/myapp
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/laravel/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

**Warning**: This quick setup is only intended for development environments. You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options for the [MariaDB container](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb#readme) for a more secure deployment.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

## Introduction

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a web application framework for [PHP](https://php.net), released as free and open-source software under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The Bitnami Laravel Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Laravel development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Laravel Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Laravel Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Laravel application:

```console
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/laravel/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```console
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/laravel/docker-compose.yml
```

Finally launch the Laravel application development environment using:

```console
docker-compose up
```

Among other things, the above command creates a container service, named `myapp`, for Laravel development and bootstraps a new Laravel application in the application directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

> **Note**
>
> If the application directory contained the source code of an existing Laravel application, the Bitnami Laravel Development Container would load the existing application instead of bootstrapping a new one.

After the artisan application server has been launched in the `myapp` service, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the default Laravel welcome page.

> **Note**
>
> If no application available at `http://localhost:8000` and you're running Docker on Windows, you might need to uncomment `privileged` setting for `myapp` container. Later, re-launch the Laravel application development environment as stated before.

In addition to the Laravel Development Container, the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/laravel/docker-compose.yml) file also configures a MariaDB service to serve as the database backend of your Laravel application.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Laravel Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```console
docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```

, where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples of launching some commonly used Laravel development commands inside the `myapp` service container.

* List all `artisan` commands:

  ```console
  docker-compose exec myapp php artisan list
  ```

* List all registered routes:

  ```console
  docker-compose exec myapp php artisan route:list
  ```

* Create a new application controller named `UserController`:

  ```console
  docker-compose exec myapp php artisan make:controller UserController
  ```

* Installing a new composer package called `phpmailer/phpmailer` with version `5.2.*`:

  ```console
  docker-compose exec myapp composer require phpmailer/phpmailer:5.2.*
  ```

### Community supported solution

Please, note this asset is a community-supported solution. This means that the Bitnami team is not actively working on new features/improvements nor providing support through GitHub Issues. Any new issue will stay open for 20 days to allow the community to contribute, after 15 days without activity the issue will be marked as stale being closed after 5 days.
