# Apache ZooKeeper packaged by Bitnami

## What is Apache ZooKeeper?

> Apache ZooKeeper provides a reliable, centralized register of configuration data and services for distributed applications.

[Overview of Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org)
Trademarks: This software listing is packaged by Bitnami. The respective trademarks mentioned in the offering are owned by the respective companies, and use of them does not imply any affiliation or endorsement.

## TL;DR

```console
docker run --name zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181:2181'
```

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## How to deploy Apache ZooKeeper in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami Apache ZooKeeper Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/zookeeper).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.dev/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

## Why use a non-root container?

Non-root container images add an extra layer of security and are generally recommended for production environments. However, because they run as a non-root user, privileged tasks are typically off-limits. Learn more about non-root containers [in our docs](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/work-with-non-root-containers/).

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

Subscribe to project updates by watching the [bitnami/containers GitHub repo](https://github.com/bitnami/containers).

## Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Apache ZooKeeper Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/zookeeper).

```console
docker pull bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/zookeeper/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
docker pull bitnami/zookeeper:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command. Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` path placeholders in the example command below with the correct values.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP:latest .
```

## Persisting your data

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

**Note!**
If you have already started using Apache ZooKeeper, follow the steps on
[backing up](#backing-up-your-container) and [restoring](#restoring-a-backup) to pull the data from your running container down to your host.

The image exposes a volume at `/bitnami/zookeeper` for the Apache ZooKeeper data. For persistence you can mount a directory at this location from your host. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run.

```console
docker run -v /path/to/zookeeper-persistence:/bitnami/zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or by modifying the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/zookeeper/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zookeeper-persistence:/bitnami/zookeeper
  ...
```

> NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

## Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), an Apache ZooKeeper server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

### Using the Command Line

In this example, we will create an Apache ZooKeeper client instance that will connect to the server instance that is running on the same docker network as the client.

#### Step 1: Create a network

```console
docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

#### Step 2: Launch the Apache ZooKeeper server instance

Use the `--network app-tier` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the Apache ZooKeeper container to the `app-tier` network.

```console
docker run -d --name zookeeper-server \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

#### Step 3: Launch your Apache ZooKeeper client instance

Finally we create a new container instance to launch the Apache ZooKeeper client and connect to the server created in the previous step:

```console
docker run -it --rm \
    --network app-tier \
    bitnami/zookeeper:latest zkCli.sh -server zookeeper-server:2181  get /
```

### Using a Docker Compose file

When not specified, Docker Compose automatically sets up a new network and attaches all deployed services to that network. However, we will explicitly define a new `bridge` network named `app-tier`. In this example we assume that you want to connect to the Apache ZooKeeper server from your own custom application image which is identified in the following snippet by the service name `myapp`.

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  app-tier:
    driver: bridge

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    networks:
      - app-tier
  myapp:
    image: 'YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE'
    networks:
      - app-tier
```

> **IMPORTANT**:
>
> 1. Please update the `YOUR_APPLICATION_IMAGE` placeholder in the above snippet with your application image
> 2. In your application container, use the hostname `zookeeper` to connect to the Apache ZooKeeper server

Launch the containers using:

```console
docker-compose up -d
```

```console
docker run --name zookeeper -e ZOO_SERVER_ID=1 bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/zookeeper/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
  ...
    environment:
      - ZOO_SERVER_ID=1
  ...
```

### Apache ZooKeeper Configuration

The image looks for configuration in the `conf/` directory of `/opt/bitnami/zookeeper`.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper -v /path/to/zoo.cfg:/opt/bitnami/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg  bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

After that, your changes will be taken into account in the server's behaviour.

#### Step 1: Run the Apache ZooKeeper image

Run the Apache ZooKeeper image, mounting a directory from your host.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper -v /path/to/zoo.cfg:/opt/bitnami/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181:2181'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zoo.cfg:/opt/bitnami/zookeeper/conf/zoo.cfg
```

#### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

```console
vi /path/to/zoo.cfg
```

#### Step 3: Restart Apache ZooKeeper

After changing the configuration, restart your Apache ZooKeeper container for changes to take effect.

```console
docker restart zookeeper
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose restart zookeeper
```

### Security

Authentication based on SASL/Digest-MD5 can be easily enabled by passing the `ZOO_ENABLE_AUTH` env var.
When enabling the Apache ZooKeeper authentication, it is also required to pass the list of users and passwords that will
be able to login.

> Note: Authentication is enabled using the CLI tool `zkCli.sh`. Therefore, it's necessary to set
`ZOO_CLIENT_USER` and `ZOO_CLIENT_PASSWORD` environment variables too.

```console
docker run -it -e ZOO_ENABLE_AUTH=yes \
               -e ZOO_SERVER_USERS=user1,user2 \
               -e ZOO_SERVER_PASSWORDS=pass4user1,pass4user2 \
               -e ZOO_CLIENT_USER=user1 \
               -e ZOO_CLIENT_PASSWORD=pass4user1 \
               bitnami/zookeeper
```

or modify the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/zookeeper/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  zookeeper:
  ...
    environment:
      - ZOO_ENABLE_AUTH=yes
      - ZOO_SERVER_USERS=user1,user2
      - ZOO_SERVER_PASSWORDS=pass4user1,pass4user2
      - ZOO_CLIENT_USER=user1
      - ZOO_CLIENT_PASSWORD=pass4user1
  ...
```

### Setting up an Apache ZooKeeper ensemble

An Apache ZooKeeper (<https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.1.2/zookeeperAdmin.html>) cluster can easily be setup with the Bitnami Apache ZooKeeper Docker image using the following environment variables:

* `ZOO_SERVERS`: Comma, space or semi-colon separated list of servers. This can be done with or without specifying the ID of the server in the ensemble. No defaults. Examples:
* without Server ID - zoo1:2888:3888,zoo2:2888:3888
* with Server ID - zoo1:2888:3888::1,zoo2:2888:3888::2
* without Server ID and Observers - zoo1:2888:3888,zoo2:2888:3888:observer
* with Server ID and Observers - zoo1:2888:3888::1,zoo2:2888:3888:observer::2

For reliable Apache ZooKeeper service, you should deploy Apache ZooKeeper in a cluster known as an ensemble. As long as a majority of the ensemble are up, the service will be available. Because Apache ZooKeeper requires a majority, it is best to use an odd number of machines. For example, with four machines Apache ZooKeeper can only handle the failure of a single machine; if two machines fail, the remaining two machines do not constitute a majority. However, with five machines Apache ZooKeeper can handle the failure of two machines.

You have to use 0.0.0.0 as the host for the server. More concretely, if the ID of the zookeeper1 container starting is 1, then the ZOO_SERVERS environment variable has to be 0.0.0.0:2888:3888,zookeeper2:2888:3888,zookeeper3:2888:3888 or if the ID of zookeeper servers are non-sequential then they need to be specified 0.0.0.0:2888:3888::2,zookeeper2:2888:3888::4.zookeeper3:2888:3888::6

See below:

Create a Docker network to enable visibility to each other via the docker container name

```console
docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

#### Step 1: Create the first node

The first step is to create one Apache ZooKeeper instance.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper1 \
  --network app-tier \
  -e ZOO_SERVER_ID=1 \
  -e ZOO_SERVERS=0.0.0.0:2888:3888,zookeeper2:2888:3888,zookeeper3:2888:3888 \
  -p 2181:2181 \
  -p 2888:2888 \
  -p 3888:3888 \
  bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

#### Step 2: Create the second node

Next we start a new Apache ZooKeeper container.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper2 \
  --network app-tier \
  -e ZOO_SERVER_ID=2 \
  -e ZOO_SERVERS=zookeeper1:2888:3888,0.0.0.0:2888:3888,zookeeper3:2888:3888 \
  -p 2181:2181 \
  -p 2888:2888 \
  -p 3888:3888 \
  bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

#### Step 3: Create the third node

Next we start another new Apache ZooKeeper container.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper3 \
  --network app-tier \
  -e ZOO_SERVER_ID=3 \
  -e ZOO_SERVERS=zookeeper1:2888:3888,zookeeper2:2888:3888,0.0.0.0:2888:3888 \
  -p 2181:2181 \
  -p 2888:2888 \
  -p 3888:3888 \
  bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

You now have a two node Apache ZooKeeper cluster up and running. You can scale the cluster by adding/removing slaves without incurring any downtime.

With Docker Compose the ensemble can be setup using:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  zookeeper1:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181'
      - '2888'
      - '3888'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zookeeper-persistence:/bitnami/zookeeper
    environment:
      - ZOO_SERVER_ID=1
      - ZOO_SERVERS=0.0.0.0:2888:3888,zookeeper2:2888:3888,zookeeper3:2888:3888
  zookeeper2:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181'
      - '2888'
      - '3888'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zookeeper-persistence:/bitnami/zookeeper
    environment:
      - ZOO_SERVER_ID=2
      - ZOO_SERVERS=zookeeper1:2888:3888,0.0.0.0:2888:3888,zookeeper3:2888:3888
  zookeeper3:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181'
      - '2888'
      - '3888'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zookeeper-persistence:/bitnami/zookeeper
    environment:
      - ZOO_SERVER_ID=3
      - ZOO_SERVERS=zookeeper1:2888:3888,zookeeper2:2888:3888,0.0.0.0:2888:3888
```

### Start Apache ZooKeeper with TLS

```console
docker run --name zookeeper \
  -v /path/to/domain.key:/bitnami/zookeeper/certs/domain.key:ro
  -v /path/to/domain.crs:/bitnami/zookeeper/certs/domain.crs:ro
  -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
  -e ZOO_TLS_CLIENT_ENABLE=yes \
  -e ZOO_TLS_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_FILE=/bitnami/zookeeper/certs/domain.key\
  -e ZOO_TLS_CLIENT_TRUSTSTORE_FILE=/bitnami/zookeeper/certs/domain.crs\
  bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

## Logging

The Bitnami Apache ZooKeeper Docker image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
docker logs zookeeper
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose logs zookeeper
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

## Maintenance

### Backing up your container

To backup your data, follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Stop the currently running container

```console
docker stop zookeeper
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose stop zookeeper
```

#### Step 2: Run the backup command

We need to mount two volumes in a container we will use to create the backup: a directory on your host to store the backup in, and the volumes from the container we just stopped so we can access the data.

```console
docker run --rm -v /path/to/zookeeper-backups:/backups --volumes-from zookeeper busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/zookeeper /backups/latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker run --rm -v /path/to/zookeeper-backups:/backups --volumes-from `docker-compose ps -q zookeeper` busybox \
  cp -a /bitnami/zookeeper /backups/latest
```

### Restoring a backup

Restoring a backup is as simple as mounting the backup as volumes in the container.

```console
docker run -v /path/to/zookeeper-backups/latest:/bitnami/zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  zookeeper:
    image: 'bitnami/zookeeper:latest'
    ports:
      - '2181:2181'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/zookeeper-backups/latest:/bitnami/zookeeper
```

### Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Apache ZooKeeper, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

#### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
docker pull bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to
`bitnami/zookeeper:latest`.

#### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Before continuing, you should backup your container's data, configuration and logs.

Follow the steps on [creating a backup](#backing-up-your-container).

#### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```console
docker rm -v zookeeper
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose rm -v zookeeper
```

#### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image, [restoring your backup](#restoring-a-backup) if necessary.

```console
docker run --name zookeeper bitnami/zookeeper:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```console
docker-compose up zookeeper
```

## Notable Changes

### 3.5.5-r95

* Apache ZooKeeper configuration moved to bash scripts in the rootfs/ folder.

### 3.4.12-r25

* Configuration is not persisted, it is regenerated each time the container is created or it is used as volume.

### 3.4.10-r4

* The zookeeper container has been migrated to a non-root container approach. Previously the container run as `root` user and the zookeeper daemon was started as `zookeeper` user. From now own, both the container and the zookeeper daemon run as user `1001`.
  As a consequence, the configuration files are writable by the user running the zookeeper process.

### 3.4.10-r0

* New release
