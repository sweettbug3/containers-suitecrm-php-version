## TL;DR

### Local workspace

```console
mkdir ~/myapp && cd ~/myapp
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/symfony/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up
```

**Warning**: This quick setup is only intended for development environments. You are encouraged to change the insecure default credentials and check out the available configuration options for the [MariaDB container](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/blob/main/bitnami/mariadb#readme) for a more secure deployment.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Supported tags and respective `Dockerfile` links

Learn more about the Bitnami tagging policy and the difference between rolling tags and immutable tags [in our documentation page](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/understand-rolling-tags-containers/).

You can see the equivalence between the different tags by taking a look at the `tags-info.yaml` file present in the branch folder, i.e `bitnami/ASSET/BRANCH/DISTRO/tags-info.yaml`.

## Introduction

[Symfony](https://symfony.com/), is a web application framework written in [PHP](http://www.php.net) under [MIT License](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/license.html).

The Bitnami Symfony Development Container has been carefully engineered to provide you and your team with a highly reproducible Symfony development environment. We hope you find the Bitnami Symfony Development Container useful in your quest for world domination. Happy hacking!

[Learn more about Bitnami Development Containers.](https://docs.bitnami.com/containers/how-to/use-bitnami-development-containers/)

## Getting started

The quickest way to get started with the Bitnami Symfony Development Container is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

Begin by creating a directory for your Symfony application:

```console
mkdir ~/myapp
cd ~/myapp
```

Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/symfony/docker-compose.yml) file in the application directory:

```console
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/symfony/docker-compose.yml
```

Set a few environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  myapp:
    image: 'bitnami/symfony:1'
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - '.:/app'
    environment:
      - SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME=myapp
      - MARIADB_HOST=mariadb
      - MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER=3306
      - MARIADB_USER=bobby
      - MARIADB_PASSWORD=tables
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=myapp
    depends_on:
      - mariadb
  mariadb:
    image: 'bitnami/mariadb:10.3'
    environment:
      - ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
      - MARIADB_USER=bobby
      - MARIADB_PASSWORD=tables
      - MARIADB_DATABASE=myapp
```

Finally launch the Symfony application development environment using:

```console
docker-compose up
```

The above command creates a container service for Symfony development and bootstraps a new Symfony application, named `myapp` in working directory. You can use your favorite IDE for developing the application.

After the built-in PHP application server has been started, visit `http://localhost:8000` in your favorite web browser and you'll be greeted by the Symfony welcome page.

## Executing commands

Commands can be launched inside the `myapp` Symfony Development Container with `docker-compose` using the [exec](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/) command.

> **Note**:
>
> The `exec` command was added to `docker-compose` in release [1.7.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#170-2016-04-13). Please ensure that you're using `docker-compose` version `1.7.0` or higher.

The general structure of the `exec` command is:

```console
docker-compose exec <service> <command>
```

where `<service>` is the name of the container service as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file and `<command>` is the command you want to launch inside the service.

Following are a few examples:

* Create a new project named `foo`:

  ```console
  docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject foo
  ```

* Create a new project named `bar` which uses Symfony version `2.5.0`

  ```console
  docker-compose run myapp nami execute symfony createProject "bar 2.5.0"
  ```

  Note: In the above two examples the `docker-compose.yml` file should be updated so that the `SYMFONY_PROJECT_NAME` specifies the project name that should be served my the PHP application server.

## Issues

If you encountered a problem running this container, you can file an [issue](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/new). Be sure to include the following information in your issue:

* Host OS and version
* Docker version (`docker version`)
* Output of `docker info`
* Version of this container
* The command you used to run the container, and any relevant output you saw (masking any sensitive information)

### Community supported solution

Please, note this asset is a community-supported solution. This means that the Bitnami team is not actively working on new features/improvements nor providing support through GitHub Issues. Any new issue will stay open for 20 days to allow the community to contribute, after 15 days without activity the issue will be marked as stale being closed after 5 days.

The Bitnami team will review any PR that is created, feel free to create a PR if you find any issue or want to implement a new feature.

New versions and releases cadence are not going to be affected. Once a new version is released in the upstream project, the Bitnami container image will be updated to use the latest version, supporting the different branches supported by the upstream project as usual.
