# The Bitnami Containers Library

Popular applications, provided by [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com), containerized and ready to launch.

## Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released on a regular basis with the latest distribution packages available.

## Get an image

The recommended way to get any of the Bitnami Images is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/).

```console
docker pull bitnami/APP
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag.

```console
docker pull bitnami/APP:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile and executing the `docker build` command.

```console
git clone https://github.com/bitnami/containers.git
cd bitnami/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t bitnami/APP .
```

> Remember to replace the `APP`, `VERSION` and `OPERATING-SYSTEM` placeholders in the example command above with the correct values.

## Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of each application contains a functional `docker-compose.yml` file. Run the application using it as shown below:

```console
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/containers/main/bitnami/APP/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```

> Remember to replace the `APP` placeholder in the example command above with the correct value.

## Vulnerability scan in Bitnami container images

As part of the release process, the Bitnami container images are analyzed for vulnerabilities. At this moment, we are using two different tools:

* [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
* [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype)

This scanning process is triggered via a GH action for every PR affecting the source code of the containers, regardless of its nature or origin.

## Contributing

We'd love for you to contribute to those container images. You can request new features by creating an [issue](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/issues/new/choose), or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/bitnami/containers/pulls) with your contribution.
